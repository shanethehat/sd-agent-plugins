IPMI Monitor
===

This plugin is for [ipmitool](http://ipmitool.sourceforge.net/).

Setup
---

To query your local IPMI board using ipmitool the plugin needs to execute the following
using sudo:

`sudo ipmitool sensor`

Depending on how you are running the agent you maybe need to give the sd-agent more permissions.

Recommended alerts

* `temp-cpu-*` - CPU temperatues, if this suddenly spikes or increases a fan might be broken.
* `temp-system` - Sensors on the mainboard, raised values might indicate air intake into the case is broken.
* `temp-peripheral` - Peripheral temperatures, raised values might indicate A/C problems or a fire in your datacenter.
* `speed-fan-*` - Fan speeds (RPM), a value of 0 would indicate that your fan is broken.
* `power-supply-*` - Power supply status, a value of 0 would indicate a unplugged supply.
