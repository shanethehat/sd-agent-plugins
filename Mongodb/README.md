MongoDB Plugin
===

This plugin gets stats from a [MongoDB server](http://www.mongodb.com)

Requirements
---
* pymongo

Installation
---
1. Check if you have pymongo installed. Run:
```
python
```
Once the shell appears enter:
```
import pymongo
pymongo.version
```
When you hit return, if the command completes and you get no errors then you have the module already installed and can skip to step 2 below.
Otherwise you'll get the following error:
```
ImportError: No module named pymongo
```
Also check the version number so you have the latest version with all updates. Older versions do not support some features / syntax so we recommend at least version 2.1 and require at least version 1.8.

2. Install pymongo:
```
pip install pymongo
```
or
```
easy_install pymongo
```
or
```
git clone git://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver.git pymongo
cd pymongo
sudo python setup.py install
```
(pip is recommended if it's available)

3. Copy the Mongodb.py file into the plugins directory

4. Configure the plugin with your server settings

5. Restart the agent

Configuration
---
1. This plugin uses a section of the configuration file called ```MongoDB```. All the configuration entries should be in it for the plugin to read them.
2. Set your mongoDB host and port, by default the plugin assumes 127.0.0.1 and 27017. To do so use the agent configuration entry: mongodb_plugin_server.
Example: ```mongodb_plugin_server: 127.0.0.1:27017``
3. Define if the individual database stats are to be collected with the agent configuration adding the entry ```mongodb_plugin_dbstats: yes```
4. Restart the agent.

Config Parameters
---
All parameters must be in the MongoDB section of the configuration file
* `mongodb_plugin_server` - MongoDB server host and port in the format:
```
host:port
```
or
```
mongodb://user:pass@host:port
```
* `mongodb_plugin_dbstats` - Define if the individual database metrics are to be collected. The metrics will be collected if the value is "yes"
* `mongodb_plugin_replset` - Replica set configuration is collected if the value is "yes"

Example:

```
[MongoDB]
mongodb_plugin_server: 127.0.0.1:27017
mongodb_plugin_dbstats: yes
mongodb_plugin_replset: no
```

Recommended alerts
---
* `replSet_isMaster` - If you expect this server to be master all the time then set an alert on this for equal to `false`. This value is `true` when this server is master.
* `replSet_myState` - This is a numerical value of the [current state of this server based on this range of states](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/replica-states/).
* `lock_percent` - If this value is very high you may have be experiencing capacity problems with your server
* `connections_current` - This value shouldn't grow too much (ideally it should be under a few thousand connections in busy applications)
* `connections_available` - This value should never get to 0
* `opcounters_*` - This value indicates the activity of your server. It should be consistent with your app behavior
* `indexCounters_missRatioPS` - This value should be 0 or almost zero. Otherwise you're missing indexes
